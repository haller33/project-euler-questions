*   Problem 539

   Start from an ordered list of all integers from 1 to n. Going from left to
   right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until the
   end of the list. Repeat the procedure from right to left, removing the
   right most number and every other number from the numbers left. Continue
   removing every other numbers, alternating left to right and right to left,
   until a single number remains.

   Starting with n = 9, we have:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   2 4 6 8
   2 6
   6

   Let P(n) be the last number left starting with a list of length n.
   Let $\displaystyle S(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n P(k)$.
   You are given P(1)=1, P(9) = 6, P(1000)=510, S(1000)=268271.

   Find S(10^18) mod 987654321.
