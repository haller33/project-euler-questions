*   Problem 205

   Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2,
   3, 4.
   Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
   5, 6.

   Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total
   wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal.

   What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin? Give your
   answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg
