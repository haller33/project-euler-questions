*   Problem 755

   Consider the Fibonacci sequence $\{1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots\}$.

   We let $f(n)$ be the number of ways of representing an integer $n\ge 0$ as
   the sum of different Fibonacci numbers.
   For example, $16 = 3+13 = 1+2+13 = 3+5+8 = 1+2+5+8$ and hence $f(16) = 4$.
   By convention $f(0) = 1$.

   Further we define $$\displaystyle S(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n f(k)$$ You are given
   $S(100) = 415$ and $S(10^4) = 312807$.

   Find $\displaystyle S(10^{13})$.
