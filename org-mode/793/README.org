*   Problem 793

   Let $S_i$ be an integer sequence produced with the following pseudo-random
   number generator:

     * $S_0 = 290797$
     * $S_{i+1} = S_i ^2 \bmod 50515093$

   Let $M(n)$ be the median of the pairwise products $ S_i S_j $ for $0 \le i
   \lt j \lt n$.

   You are given $M(3) = 3878983057768$ and $M(103) = 492700616748525$.

   Find $M(1\,000\,003)$.
