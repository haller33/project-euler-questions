*   Problem 312

   - A Sierpiński graph of order-1 (S_1) is an equilateral triangle.
   - S_n+1 is obtained from S_n by positioning three copies of S_n so that
   every pair of copies has one common corner.

   Let C(n) be the number of cycles that pass exactly once through all the
   vertices of S_n.
   For example, C(3) = 8 because eight such cycles can be drawn on S_3, as
   shown below:

                             p312_sierpinsky8t.gif

   It can also be verified that :
   C(1) = C(2) = 1
   C(5) = 71328803586048
   C(10 000) mod 10^8 = 37652224
   C(10 000) mod 13^8 = 617720485

   Find C(C(C(10 000))) mod 13^8.
