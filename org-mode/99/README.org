*   Problem 99

   Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not
   difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.

   However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much more
   difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

   Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text
   file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line,
   determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

   NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example
   given above.
