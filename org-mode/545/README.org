*   Problem 545

   The sum of the k^th powers of the first n positive integers can be
   expressed as a polynomial of degree k+1 with rational coefficients, the
   Faulhaber's Formulas:
   $1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k = \sum_{i=1}^n i^k = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} a_{i} n^i =
   a_{1} n + a_{2} n^2 + ... + a_{k} n^k + a_{k+1} n^{k + 1}$,
   where a_i's are rational coefficients that can be written as reduced
   fractions p_i/q_i (if a_i = 0, we shall consider q_i = 1).

   For example, $1^4 + 2^4 + ... + n^4 = -\frac 1 {30} n + \frac 1 3 n^3 +
   \frac 1 2 n^4 + \frac 1 5 n^5.$

   Define D(k) as the value of q_1 for the sum of k^th powers (i.e. the
   denominator of the reduced fraction a_1).
   Define F(m) as the m^th value of k ≥ 1 for which D(k) = 20010.
   You are given D(4) = 30 (since a_1 = -1/30), D(308) = 20010, F(1) = 308,
   F(10) = 96404.

   Find F(10^5).
