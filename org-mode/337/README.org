*   Problem 337

   Let {a_1, a_2,..., a_n} be an integer sequence of length n such that:

     * a_1 = 6
     * for all 1 ≤ i < n : φ(a_i) < φ(a_i+1) < a_i < a_i+1^1

   Let S(N) be the number of such sequences with a_n ≤ N.
   For example, S(10) = 4: {6}, {6, 8}, {6, 8, 9} and {6, 10}.
   We can verify that S(100) = 482073668 and S(10 000) mod 10^8 = 73808307.

   Find S(20 000 000) mod 10^8.

   ^1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.
