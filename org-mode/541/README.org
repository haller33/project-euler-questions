*   Problem 541

   The n^thharmonic number H_n is defined as the sum of the multiplicative
   inverses of the first n positive integers, and can be written as a reduced
   fraction a_n/b_n.
   $H_n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1 k = \frac {a_n} {b_n}$, with
   $\text {gcd}(a_n, b_n)=1$.

   Let M(p) be the largest value of n such that b_n is not divisible by p.

   For example, M(3) = 68 because $H_{68} = \frac {a_{68}} {b_{68}} = \frac
   {14094018321907827923954201611} {2933773379069966367528193600}$,
   b_68=2933773379069966367528193600 is not divisible by 3, but all larger
   harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.

   You are given M(7) = 719102.

   Find M(137).
