*   Problem 388

   Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N.

   From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.
   Let D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.

   You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.

   Find D(10^10). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the
   last nine digits.
