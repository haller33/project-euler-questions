*   Problem 684

   Define $s(n)$ to be the smallest number that has a digit sum of $n$. For
   example $s(10) = 19$.
   Let $\displaystyle S(k) = \sum_{n=1}^k s(n)$. You are given $S(20) =
   1074$.

   Further let $f_i$ be the Fibonacci sequence defined by $f_0=0, f_1=1$ and
   $f_i=f_{i-2}+f_{i-1}$ for all $i \ge 2$.

   Find $\displaystyle \sum_{i=2}^{90} S(f_i)$. Give your answer modulo
   $1\,000\,000\,007$.
