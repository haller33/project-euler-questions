*   Problem 45

   Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following
   formulae:

   Triangle     T_n=n(n+1)/2    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...  
   Pentagonal   P_n=n(3n−1)/2   1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... 
   Hexagonal    H_n=n(2n−1)     1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... 

   It can be verified that T_285 = P_165 = H_143 = 40755.

   Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
