*   Problem 171

   For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits
   (in base 10) of n, e.g.

   f(3) = 3^2 = 9,
   f(25) = 2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29,
   f(442) = 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36

   Find the last nine digits of the sum of all n, 0 < n < 10^20, such that
   f(n) is a perfect square.
