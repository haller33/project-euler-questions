*   Problem 742

   A symmetrical convex grid polygon is a polygon such that:

     * All its vertices have integer coordinates.
     * All its internal angles are strictly smaller than $180Â°$.
     * It has both horizontal and vertical symmetry.

   For example, the left polygon is a convex grid polygon which has neither
   horizontal nor vertical symmetry, while the right one is a valid
   symmetrical convex grid polygon with six vertices:

   Define $A(N)$, the minimum area of a symmetrical convex grid polygon with
   $N$ vertices.

   You are given $A(4) = 1$, $A(8) = 7$, $A(40) = 1039$ and $A(100) = 17473$.

   Find $A(1000)$.
