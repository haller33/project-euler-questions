*   Problem 190

   Let S_m = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_m) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers
   with x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_m = m for which P_m = x_1 * x_2^2 * ... * x_m^m
   is maximised.

   For example, it can be verified that [P_10] = 4112 ([ ] is the integer
   part function).

   Find Σ[P_m] for 2 ≤ m ≤ 15.
