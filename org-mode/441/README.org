*   Problem 441

   For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p·q) for all the integer
   pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:

     * 1 ≤ p < q ≤ M
     * p + q ≥ M
     * p and q are coprime.

   We also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2 ≤ i ≤ N.
   We can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10) ≈ 6.9147 and S(100) ≈ 58.2962.

   Find S(10^7). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
