*   Problem 91

   The points P (x_1, y_1) and Q (x_2, y_2) are plotted at integer
   co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

   There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
   formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
   0 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 2.

   Given that 0 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be
   formed?
