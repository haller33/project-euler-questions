*   Problem 239

   A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random
   order.

   What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that
   exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?
   (Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their
   natural positions.)

   Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form
   0.abcdefghijkl.
