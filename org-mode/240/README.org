*   Problem 240

   There are 1111 ways in which five 6-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 6) can
   be rolled so that the top three sum to 15. Some examples are:

   D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 4,3,6,3,5
   D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 4,3,3,5,6
   D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 3,3,3,6,6
   D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 6,6,3,3,3

   In how many ways can twenty 12-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 12) be
   rolled so that the top ten sum to 70?
