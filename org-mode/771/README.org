*   Problem 771

   We define a pseudo-geometric sequence to be a finite sequence $a_0, a_1,
   \dotsc, a_n$ of positive integers, satisfying the following conditions:

     * $n \geq 4$, i.e. the sequence has at least 5 terms.
     * $0 < a_0 < a_1 < \dotsc < a_n$, i.e. the sequence is strictly
       increasing.
     * $| a_i^2 - a_{i - 1}a_{i + 1} | \le 2$ for $1 \le i \le n-1$.

   Let $G(N)$ be the number of different pseudo-geometric sequences whose
   terms do not exceed $N$.
   For example, $G(6) = 4$, as the following $4$ sequences give a complete
   list:

 $1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \qquad 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 \qquad 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \qquad 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                                       6$

   Also, $G(10) = 26$, $G(100) = 4710$ and $G(1000) = 496805$.

   Find $G(10^{18})$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
