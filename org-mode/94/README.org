*   Problem 94

   It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
   length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle
   5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.

   We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which
   two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

   Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with
   integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one
   billion (1,000,000,000).
