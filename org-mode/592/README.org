*   Problem 592

   For any N, let f(N) be the last twelve hexadecimal digits before the
   trailing zeroes in N!.

   For example, the hexadecimal representation of 20! is 21C3677C82B40000,
   so f(20) is the digit sequence 21C3677C82B4.

   Find f(20!). Give your answer as twelve hexadecimal digits, using
   uppercase for the digits A to F.
