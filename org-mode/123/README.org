*   Problem 123

   Let p_n be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder
   when (p_n−1)^n + (p_n+1)^n is divided by p_n^2.

   For example, when n = 3, p_3 = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

   The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037.

   Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.
