*   Problem 804

   Let $g(n)$ denote the number of ways a positive integer $n$ can be
   represented in the form: $$x^2+xy+41y^2$$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers.
   For example, $g(53)=4$ due to $(x,y) \in \{(-4,1),(-3,-1),(3,1),(4,-1)\}$.

   Define $\displaystyle T(N)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}g(n)$. You are given
   $T(10^3)=474$ and $T(10^6)=492128$.

   Find $T(10^{16})$.
