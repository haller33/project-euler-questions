*   Problem 571

   A positive number is pandigital in base b if it contains all digits from 0
   to b - 1 at least once when written in base b.

   A n-super-pandigital number is a number that is simultaneously pandigital
   in all bases from 2 to n inclusively.
   For example 978 = 1111010010_2 = 1100020_3 = 33102_4 = 12403_5 is the
   smallest 5-super-pandigital number.
   Similarly, 1093265784 is the smallest 10-super-pandigital number.
   The sum of the 10 smallest 10-super-pandigital numbers is 20319792309.

   What is the sum of the 10 smallest 12-super-pandigital numbers?
