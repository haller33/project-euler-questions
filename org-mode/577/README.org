*   Problem 577

   An equilateral triangle with integer side length $n \ge 3$ is divided into
   $n^2$ equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the diagram
   below.
   The vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with
   $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)} 2$ lattice points.

   Let $H(n)$ be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by
   connecting 6 of these points.

   For example, $H(3)=1$, $H(6)=12$ and $H(20)=966$.

   Find $\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^{12345} H(n)$.
