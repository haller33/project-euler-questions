*   Problem 455

   Let f(n) be the largest positive integer x less than 10^9 such that the
   last 9 digits of n^x form the number x (including leading zeros), or zero
   if no such integer exists.

   For example:

     * f(4) = 411728896 (4^411728896 = ...490411728896)
     * f(10) = 0
     * f(157) = 743757 (157^743757 = ...567000743757)
     * ∑ f(n), 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 = 442530011399

   Find ∑ f(n), 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
