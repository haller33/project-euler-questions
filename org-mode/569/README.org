*   Problem 569

   A mountain range consists of a line of mountains with slopes of exactly
   45°, and heights governed by the prime numbers, p_n. The up-slope of the
   k^th mountain is of height p_2k−1, and the downslope is p_2k. The first
   few foot-hills of this range are illustrated below.

   Tenzing sets out to climb each one in turn, starting from the lowest. At
   the top of each peak, he looks back and counts how many of the previous
   peaks he can see. In the example above, the eye-line from the third
   mountain is drawn in red, showing that he can only see the peak of the
   second mountain from this viewpoint. Similarly, from the 9^th mountain, he
   can see three peaks, those of the 5^th, 7^th and 8^th mountain.

   Let P(k) be the number of peaks that are visible looking back from the
   k^th mountain. Hence P(3)=1 and P(9)=3.
   Also $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{100} P(k) = 227$.

   Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{2500000} P(k)$.
