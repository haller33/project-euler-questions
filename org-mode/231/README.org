*   Problem 231

   The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
   $120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$, and
   $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.
   So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle
   \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.

   Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle
   \binom {20\,000\,000} {15\,000\,000}$.
