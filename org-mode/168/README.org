*   Problem 168

   Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the
   last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.
   It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.
   This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its
   right-rotation.

   Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10^100, that
   have this property.
