*   Problem 243

   A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called
   a proper fraction.
   For any denominator, d, there will be d−1 proper fractions; for example,
   with d = 12:
   ^1/_12 , ^2/_12 , ^3/_12 , ^4/_12 , ^5/_12 , ^6/_12 , ^7/_12 , ^8/_12 ,
   ^9/_12 , ^10/_12 , ^11/_12 .

   We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient
   fraction.
   Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be
   the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) =
   ^4/_11 .
   In fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) <
   ^4/_10 .

   Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) < ^15499/_94744
   .
