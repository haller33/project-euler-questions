*   Problem 356

   Let a_n be the largest real root of a polynomial g(x) = x^3 - 2^nÂ·x^2 + n.
   For example, a_2 = 3.86619826...

   Find the last eight digits of $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{30} {\left \lfloor
   a_i^{987654321} \right \rfloor}$.

   Note: $\lfloor a \rfloor$ represents the floor function.
