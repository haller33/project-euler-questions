*   Problem 695

   Three points, $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$, are randomly selected within a unit
   square. Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of
   the unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three line segments
   $\overline{P_1P_2}$, $\overline{P_1P_3}$ or $\overline{P_2P_3}$ (see
   picture below).

   3 random rectangles

   We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the
   example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the
   diagonal $\overline{P_2P_3}$.

   Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three
   rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
