*   Problem 113

   Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
   left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

   Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
   decreasing number; for example, 66420.

   We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
   a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

   As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such
   that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy
   and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10^10.

   How many numbers below a googol (10^100) are not bouncy?
