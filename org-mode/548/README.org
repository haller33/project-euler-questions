*   Problem 548

   A gozinta chain for n is a sequence {1,a,b,...,n} where each element
   properly divides the next.
   There are eight gozinta chains for 12:
   {1,12} ,{1,2,12}, {1,2,4,12}, {1,2,6,12}, {1,3,12}, {1,3,6,12}, {1,4,12}
   and {1,6,12}.
   Let g(n) be the number of gozinta chains for n, so g(12)=8.
   g(48)=48 and g(120)=132.

   Find the sum of the numbers n not exceeding 10^16 for which g(n)=n.
