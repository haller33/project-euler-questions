*   Problem 228

   Let S_n be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices v_k
   (k = 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:

          x_k   =   cos( ^2k-1/_n ×180° ) 
          y_k   =   sin( ^2k-1/_n ×180° ) 

   Each S_n is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points
   on the perimeter and in the interior.

   The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding
   every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed
   coordinate-wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).

   For example, the sum of S_3 and S_4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink
   below:

   picture showing S_3 + S_4

   How many sides does S_1864 + S_1865 + … + S_1909 have?
