*   Problem 596

   Let T(r) be the number of integer quadruplets x, y, z, t such that x^2 +
   y^2 + z^2 + t^2 â‰¤ r^2. In other words, T(r) is the number of lattice
   points in the four-dimensional hyperball of radius r.

   You are given that T(2) = 89, T(5) = 3121, T(100) = 493490641 and T(10^4)
   = 49348022079085897.

   Find T(10^8) mod 1000000007.
