*   Problem 221

   We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there
   exist integers p, q, r such that:

   $$A = p \cdot q \cdot r$$ and $$\dfrac{1}{A} = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{1}{q}
   + \dfrac{1}{r}$$

   For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer ($p = 5, q = -7, r = -18$). In
   fact, 630 is the 6^th Alexandrian integer, the first 6 Alexandrian
   integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420, and 630.

   Find the 150000^th Alexandrian integer.
