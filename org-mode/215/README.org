*   Problem 215

   Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks
   (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps
   between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers,
   i.e. never form a "running crack".

   For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running
   crack shown in red:

   There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.

   Calculate W(32,10).
