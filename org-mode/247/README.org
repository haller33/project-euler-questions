*   Problem 247

   Consider the region constrained by 1 ≤ x and 0 ≤ y ≤ ^1/_x.

   Let S_1 be the largest square that can fit under the curve.
   Let S_2 be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.
   Let the index of S_n be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of
   squares to the left of S_n and the number of squares below S_n.

   The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.
   S_2 has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S_2 is
   (1,0).
   It can be seen that the index of S_32 is (1,1) as is the index of S_50.
   50 is the largest n for which the index of S_n is (1,1).

   What is the largest n for which the index of S_n is (3,3)?
