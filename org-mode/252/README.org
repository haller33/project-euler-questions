*   Problem 252

   Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex
   polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not containing any
   of the given points in its interior (in addition to the vertices, other
   given points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon).

   As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few such
   convex holes. The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to
   1049694.5 square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex
   hole on the given set of points.

   For our example, we used the first 20 points (T_2k−1, T_2k), for
   k = 1,2,…,20, produced with the pseudo-random number generator:

S_0   =_  290797_                   
S_n+1 =_  S_n^2 mod 50515093        
T_n   =_  ( S_n mod 2000 ) − 1000^  

   i.e. (527, 144), (−488, 732), (−454, −947), …

   What is the maximum area for a convex hole on the set containing the first
   500 points in the pseudo-random sequence?
   Specify your answer including one digit after the decimal point.
