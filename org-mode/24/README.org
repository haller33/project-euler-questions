*   Problem 24

   A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is
   one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the
   permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
   lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

   012   021   102   120   201   210

   What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
