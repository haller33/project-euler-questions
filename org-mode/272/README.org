*   Problem 272

   For a positive number n, define C(n) as the number of the integers x, for
   which 1<x<n and
   x^3≡1 mod n.

   When n=91, there are 8 possible values for x, namely : 9, 16, 22, 29, 53,
   74, 79, 81.
   Thus, C(91)=8.

   Find the sum of the positive numbers n≤10^11 for which C(n)=242.
