*   Problem 270

   A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a
   corner at the origin and two of its sides along the x- and y-axes. Then,
   we cut it up respecting the following rules:

     * We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides
       of the square, and having integer coordinates.
     * Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border
       point.
     * Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.

   Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number
   of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown
   below).

   What is C(30) mod 10^8 ?
