*   Problem 759

   The function $f$ is defined for all positive integers as follows:

   \begin{align*} f(1) &= 1\\ f(2n) &= 2f(n)\\ f(2n+1) &= 2n+1 + 2f(n)+\tfrac
   1n f(n) \end{align*}

   It can be proven that $f(n)$ is integer for all values of $n$.

   The function $S(n)$ is defined as $S(n) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n f(i)
   ^2$.

   For example, $S(10)=1530$ and $S(10^2)=4798445$.

   Find $S(10^{16})$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
