*   Problem 719

   We define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a perfect
   square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal
   representation of $n$ into 2 or more numbers then adding the numbers.

   For example, 81 is an $S$-number because $\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.
   6724 is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$.
   8281 is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.
   9801 is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.

   Further we define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all $S$ numbers $n\le N$. You
   are given $T(10^4) = 41333$.

   Find $T(10^{12})$
