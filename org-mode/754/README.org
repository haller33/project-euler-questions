*   Problem 754

   The Gauss Factorial of a number $n$ is defined as the product of all
   positive numbers $\leq n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. For example
   $g(10)=1\times 3\times 7\times 9 = 189$.

   Also we define $$\displaystyle G(n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}g(i)$$

   You are given $G(10) = 23044331520000$.

   Find $G(10^8)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
