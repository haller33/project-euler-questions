*   Problem 292

   We shall define a pythagorean polygon to be a convex polygon with the
   following properties:

     * there are at least three vertices,
     * no three vertices are aligned,
     * each vertex has integer coordinates,
     * each edge has integer length.

   For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean
   polygons for which the perimeter is ≤ n.
   Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a
   translation of another.

   You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.
   Find P(120).
