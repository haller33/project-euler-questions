*   Problem 769

   Consider the following binary quadratic form:

   $$ \begin{align} f(x,y)=x^2+5xy+3y^2 \end{align} $$

   A positive integer $q$ has a primitive representation if there exist
   positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $q = f(x,y)$ and $\gcd(x,y)=1$.

   We are interested in primitive representations of perfect squares. For
   example:
   $17^2=f(1,9)$
   $87^2=f(13,40) = f(46,19)$

   Define $C(N)$ as the total number of primitive representations of $z^2$
   for $0 < z \leq N$.
   Multiple representations are counted separately, so for example $z=87$ is
   counted twice.

   You are given $C(10^3)=142$ and $C(10^{6})=142463$

   Find $C(10^{14})$.
