*   Problem 217

   A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first
   ⌈^k/_2⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈^k/_2⌉ digits, where
   ⌈x⌉, pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer ≥ x, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4
   and ⌈5⌉ = 5.

   So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.

   Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^n.
   Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.

   Find T(47) mod 3^15
