*   Problem 572

   A matrix $M$ is called idempotent if $M^2 = M$.
   Let $M$ be a three by three matrix : $M=\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c\\ d & e
   & f\\ g &h &i\\ \end{pmatrix}$.
   Let C(n) be the number of idempotent three by three matrices $M$ with
   integer elements such that
   $ -n \le a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i \le n$.

   C(1)=164 and C(2)=848.

   Find C(200).
