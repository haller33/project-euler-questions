*   Problem 225

   The sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201 ...
   is defined by T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 1 and T_n = T_n-1 + T_n-2 + T_n-3.

   It can be shown that 27 does not divide any terms of this sequence.
   In fact, 27 is the first odd number with this property.

   Find the 124^th odd number that does not divide any terms of the above
   sequence.
