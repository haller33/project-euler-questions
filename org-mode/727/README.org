*   Problem 727

   Let $r_a$, $r_b$ and $r_c$ be the radii of three circles that are mutually
   and externally tangent to each other. The three circles then form a
   triangle of circular arcs between their tangency points as shown for the
   three blue circles in the picture below.

   CircularArcs

   Define the circumcircle of this triangle to be the red circle, with centre
   $D$, passing through their tangency points. Further define the incircle of
   this triangle to be the green circle, with centre $E$, that is mutually
   and externally tangent to all the three blue circles. Let $d=\vert DE
   \vert$ be the distance between the centres of the circumcircle and the
   incircle.

   Let $\mathbb{E}(d)$ be the expected value of $d$ when $r_a$, $r_b$ and
   $r_c$ are integers chosen uniformly such that $1\leq r_a<r_b<r_c \leq 100$
   and $\text{gcd}(r_a,r_b,r_c)=1$.

   Find $\mathbb{E}(d)$, rounded to eight places after the decimal point.
