*   Problem 110

   In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

   $$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

   It can be verified that when $n = 1260$ there are 113 distinct solutions
   and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total number of distinct
   solutions exceeds one hundred.

   What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions
   exceeds four million?

   NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as
   it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a
   clever implementation.
