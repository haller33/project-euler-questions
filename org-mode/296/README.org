*   Problem 296

   Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with BC ≤ AC ≤ AB.
   k is the angular bisector of angle ACB.
   m is the tangent at C to the circumscribed circle of ABC.
   n is a line parallel to m through B.
   The intersection of n and k is called E.

   How many triangles ABC with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such
   that BE has integral length?
