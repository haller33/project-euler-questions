*   Problem 554

   On a chess board, a centaur moves like a king or a knight. The diagram
   below shows the valid moves of a centaur (represented by an inverted king)
   on an 8x8 board.

   It can be shown that at most n^2 non-attacking centaurs can be placed on a
   board of size 2n×2n.
   Let C(n) be the number of ways to place n^2 centaurs on a 2n×2n board so
   that no centaur attacks another directly.
   For example C(1) = 4, C(2) = 25, C(10) = 1477721.

   Let F_i be the i^th Fibonacci number defined as F_1 = F_2 = 1 and
   F_i = F_i-1 + F_i-2 for i > 2.

   Find $\displaystyle \left( \sum_{i=2}^{90} C(F_i) \right) \text{mod }
   (10^8+7)$.
