*   Problem 528

   Let S(n,k,b) represent the number of valid solutions to x_1 + x_2 + ... +
   x_k ≤ n, where 0 ≤ x_m ≤ b^m for all 1 ≤ m ≤ k.

   For example, S(14,3,2) = 135, S(200,5,3) = 12949440, and S(1000,10,5) mod
   1 000 000 007 = 624839075.

   Find (∑_10 ≤ k ≤ 15 S(10^k,k,k)) mod 1 000 000 007.
