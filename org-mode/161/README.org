*   Problem 161

   A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.
   There are two basic forms:

   If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:

   Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with
   triominoes.
   If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from
   another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be tiled
   with triominoes:

   In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
