*   Problem 426

   Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
   example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed
   by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can
   be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of
   consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.

   A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the
   following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the
   nearest empty box to its right.

   After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can
   be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first
   occupied box.

                               p426_baxball1.gif

   A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.

   It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system
   evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is
   invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes
   evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.

                               p426_baxball2.gif

   We define the sequence {t_i}:

     * s_0 = 290797
     * s_k+1 = s_k^2 mod 50515093
     * t_k = (s_k mod 64) + 1

   Starting from the initial configuration (t_0, t_1, …, t_10), the final
   state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
   Starting from the initial configuration (t_0, t_1, …, t_10 000 000), find
   the final state.
   Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final
   state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1^2 + 2^2
   + 3^2) is your answer.
