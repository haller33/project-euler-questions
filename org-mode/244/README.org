*   Problem 244

   You probably know the game Fifteen Puzzle. Here, instead of numbered
   tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.

   A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right,
   Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (S),
   by the sequence LULUR we reach the configuration (E):

                 (S)   p244_start.gif  , (E)  p244_example.gif 

   For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):

   checksum = 0
   checksum = (checksum × 243 + m_1) mod 100 000 007
   checksum = (checksum × 243 + m_2) mod 100 000 007
      …
   checksum = (checksum × 243 + m_n) mod 100 000 007
   where m_k is the ASCII value of the k^th letter in the move sequence and
   the ASCII values for the moves are:

                                 +------------+
                                 |L     |76   |
                                 |------+-----|
                                 |R     |82   |
                                 |------+-----|
                                 |U     |85   |
                                 |------+-----|
                                 |D     |68   |
                                 +------------+

   For the sequence LULUR given above, the checksum would be 19761398.

   Now, starting from configuration (S), find all shortest ways to reach
   configuration (T).

                  (S)   p244_start.gif  , (T)  p244_target.gif 

   What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?
