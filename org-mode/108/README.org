*   Problem 108

   In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

   $$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

   For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

   $$\begin{align} \dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
   \dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\\ \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{8}
   &= \dfrac{1}{4} \end{align} $$

   What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
   exceeds one-thousand?

   NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly
   advised that you solve this one first.
