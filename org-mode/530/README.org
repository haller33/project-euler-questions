*   Problem 530

   Every divisor d of a number n has a complementary divisor n/d.

   Let f(n) be the sum of the greatest common divisor of d and n/d over all
   positive divisors d of n, that is $f(n)=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{d|n}\,
   \text{gcd}(d,\frac n d)$.

   Let F be the summatory function of f, that is
   $F(k)=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^k \, f(n)$.

   You are given that F(10)=32 and F(1000)=12776.

   Find F(10^15).
