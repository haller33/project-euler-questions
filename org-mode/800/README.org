*   Problem 800

   An integer of the form $p^q q^p$ with prime numbers $p \neq q$ is called a
   hybrid-integer.
   For example, $800 = 2^5 5^2$ is a hybrid-integer.

   We define $C(n)$ to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to
   $n$.
   You are given $C(800) = 2$ and $C(800^{800}) = 10790$

   Find $C(800800^{800800})$
