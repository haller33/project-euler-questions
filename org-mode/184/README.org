*   Problem 184

   Consider the set I_r of points (x,y) with integer co-ordinates in the
   interior of the circle with radius r, centered at the origin, i.e. x^2 +
   y^2 < r^2.

   For a radius of 2, I_2 contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1),
   (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight
   triangles having all three vertices in I_2 which contain the origin in the
   interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from these
   by rotation.

   For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the
   interior and having all vertices in I_3 and for I_5 the number is 10600.

   How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and
   having all three vertices in I_105?
