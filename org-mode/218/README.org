*   Problem 218

   Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25. The area
   of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and
   28.
   Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and
   gcd(b,c)=1.
   Also c is a perfect square.

   We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
   -it is a primitive right angled triangle
   -its hypotenuse is a perfect square

   We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
   -it is a perfect right angled triangle and
   -its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

   How many perfect right-angled triangles with c≤10^16 exist that are not
   super-perfect?
