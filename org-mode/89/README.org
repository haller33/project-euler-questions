*   Problem 89

   For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are
   basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some
   numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way
   of writing a particular number.

   For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing
   the number sixteen:

   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
   VIIIIIIIIIII
   VVIIIIII
   XIIIIII
   VVVI
   XVI

   However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the
   last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least
   number of numerals.

   The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
   contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily
   minimal, Roman numerals; see About... Roman Numerals for the definitive
   rules for this problem.

   Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their
   minimal form.

   Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no
   more than four consecutive identical units.
